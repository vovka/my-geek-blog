# Introduction

This is a simple test post to verify that the blog enhancement system works correctly. The post intentionally has some grammer errors and could be expanded with more detail.

## What We're Testing

We want to make sure that:
- Draft files are found
- Content is enhanced
- Output files are created with correct naming
- The agent preserves the language of the content

## Technical Details

The enhancement agent uses AI to improve content quality. It can fix grammar, add details, and insert relevant images.

## Conclusion

If this works we should see an enhanced version of this file.
