# Welcome to My Blog

This is your first blog post! It demonstrates the **Markdown to HTML** processing system with a clean, minimal design.

## Features

- **Reading time** calculation
- **Category** and **tag** organization
- Full **Markdown** syntax support
- **Featured images** for visual appeal
- **Real-time search** functionality
- **Responsive design** for all devices

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply add a new `.md` file to the `content/posts/` directory with frontmatter at the top.

### Example Structure

```markdown
