nowadays with ais there is no need to create any complicated logic. all conditional like things can be handled by ai. our task is to provide it with sufficient tools set.

but ais can also code well. and they can write tasks well. so why we need to write tools for ai when it can do it by itself. probably the only tool it would need is bash call. using it ai agent can read, write files and run programs. 

you create simple general purpose promoted agent with single bash tool and text interface for interaction with human. you don't limit it in loop cycles and API usage. you ask it to create voice interface. it would probably first create a browsing helper tool for itself. it would find how to record voice, convert voice to text. it would create submodule doing this. everything else it would have already have. 

if it would run as a web server then it would probably find way to restart itself, for example using cron, on order to apply new code. 

then you would ask it to help you with spreadsheets. it would go to internet to find documentation how to work with google docs, it would probably create a Google account for itself. then it could create for you a spreadsheet you asked. 

all this new abilities it could save as separate tools. that's probably should be initial prompt - a recommendation to create tools by itself. 

actually it sounds scary. it starts look like a skynet. you need to be extremely careful with it. please run it in docker. docker becomes a fuse for skynet😂.

it would be great to write such a sci fi book, and it would be interested not because of the ai idea with is old. but because of its implementation that is not fantasy already. it would be a scary book actually, like Stephen's king one.
